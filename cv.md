## Briefly about myself
I haven't worked yet. I have been interested in programming since 7th grade at school.
That’s exactly what I met in the frontend direction in 2020, and it’s very interesting to me.

I am currently studying at the Pedagogical Institute in my hometown. But I don’t want to work as a math teacher at school or university.
Unfortunately I don’t live in the capital and there are no IT centers in our city that are very good.
So I really want to study the frontend thoroughly and then teach other people.

I want to replicate the programming language and technology I learned, and then learn more about the IT industry, especially web programming.
My first dream is to be the "best" in my field and help the oppressed people along the way.
